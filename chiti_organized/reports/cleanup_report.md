# Cleanup Report (Deleted downloaded/generated dependencies)

Date: 2026-02-01

This report lists what was deleted to reduce repo/workspace size, what each folder was used for, how much space it occupied, and how to recreate it with the same versions.

## Deleted items (and sizes before deletion)

- `team-chitti-rag/models/` — **2.2G**
  - **What it was**: Local model caches (e.g., TinyLlama weights, embeddings model cache) downloaded during warmup/setup.
  - **Why safe to delete**: These are re-downloadable artifacts; not source code.
  - **How to recreate (same versions)**:
    - Reinstall Python deps: `python -m pip install -r team-chitti-rag/requirements.lock.txt`
    - Run backend warmup: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/warmup`
    - Or run setup script: `python team-chitti-rag/scripts/local_setup.py`

- `team-chitti-rag/frontend/node_modules/` — **110M**
  - **What it was**: Installed Node packages for the React/Vite frontend.
  - **Why safe to delete**: It is fully reproducible from `package-lock.json`.
  - **How to recreate (same versions)**:
    - `cd team-chitti-rag/frontend && npm ci`

- `team-chitti-rag/frontend/dist/` — **220K**
  - **What it was**: Production build output from `npm run build`.
  - **Why safe to delete**: It is generated output.
  - **How to recreate**:
    - `cd team-chitti-rag/frontend && npm run build`

- `team-chitti-rag/data/` — **1.7M**
  - **What it was**: Generated artifacts such as chunk caches and FAISS indexes.
  - **Why safe to delete**: Rebuildable from `src/database/sample_docs` using scripts/endpoints.
  - **How to recreate**:
    - Precompute chunks: `python team-chitti-rag/scripts/precompute_chunks.py`
    - Build index via API: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/rag/index/build`

- `team-chitti-rag/logs/` — **4.0K**
  - **What it was**: Runtime logs.
  - **Why safe to delete**: Logs are always regenerated.

- `team-chitti-rag/src/**/__pycache__/` — ~**220K total**
  - **What it was**: Python bytecode caches.
  - **Why safe to delete**: Automatically regenerated by Python.

## “What changed” summary
- Removed large downloaded/model and installed package directories to keep the repo light.
- Preserved all source code, configs, docs, scripts, and lockfiles.

Captured toolchain versions:
- `team-chitti-rag/frontend/NODE_VERSION.txt`
- `team-chitti-rag/frontend/NPM_VERSION.txt`

## How to run after reinstall

Backend:
